The *niek-ephem* tool is a C++ front end to JPL's DE405 ephemeris.  It includes:

  * A conversion utility to change JPL's ASCII interpolation coefficient files to a single binary file.
  * An interactive text-based interface to the ephemeris information. 
  * A library interface to the ephemeris information.
  * A unit testing framework.

The correctness of the implementation has been verified using the JPL Horizons web-based ephemeris system.

Currently, the documentation for this project is minimal.

The following tools and library are needed to fully utilize *niek-ephem*.  

  * Doxygen 
    (Javadoc-like tool for extracting source code documentation)
  * CppUnit
    (A unit testing framework for C++)
  * GNU Make
    (Project uses advanced features from GNU's make program, including autodependency generation).

The ephemeris interpolation coefficients must be downloaded separately from JPL.  They are available here: [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/export/ascii/]
