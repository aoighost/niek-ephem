The "niek-ephem" tool is a C++ front end to JPL's DE405 ephemeris.

It includes:
> (1) A conversion utility to change JPL's ASCII interpolation coefficient files to a single binary file.

> (2) An interactive text-based interface to the ephemeris information.

> (3) A library interface to the ephemeris information.

> (4) A unit testing framework.

The correctness of the implementation has been verified using the JPL Horizons web-based ephemeris system.
